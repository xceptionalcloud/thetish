What do we regularly have to do in the alerts board of ConnectWise?

Merge - Find and merge common alerts.

	Common alerts in almost all cases will be unique to a Company
	One time events can be seen by correllating one time range across many/all devices/data points
	Repeated similar events seen in multiple time ranges with similar device/data point

Qualify - Determine whether the alert is a real problem that needs to be addressed, or just an alerting problem.

Address false issues - Update the upstream system (LM, nCentral, the device) to prevent future false alarms.

Address positive issues - Perform whatever work necessary to remediate the alert

Handoff/Escalate - Update any alert's priority, resource, scheduling, etc., based on its percieved priority and our ability to address the issue during review.
